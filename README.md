# Hi, I'm Pauline 

 **PhD student (Biology)** in https://sites.miamioh.edu/jezkova-lab/ at Miami University (Ohio, USA), 
 **Computational Genomics | Bioinformatics | Species Delimitation** 
 Applying advanced genomic tools to study biodiversity, conservation, and evolutionary processes.

## About Me
I am a computational biologist with a strong focus on **population genomics**, **species delimitation**, and **gene flow analysis**. 
My work integrates **high-throughput sequencing data (RADseq, WGS)** with **phylogenetic and Bayesian modeling** to answer key questions in evolutionary biology.

## 📚 Teaching Experience

- **Co-Instructor – LAMBDA Workshop (August 2025)**  

  *Genetics module* – 4-day training covering VCF analysis, phylogenetic trees, structure analysis, and population genetics in R.

- **Laboratory Tutor – Principles of Human Physiology (Fall 2023 – Spring 2024)**  

  Guided students through laboratory experiments, data analysis, and interpretation; held office hours to support learning.

## 🌱 Field Research Experience
- **Salamander Ecology & Population Monitoring (Miami University – Ecology Research Center)**  
Conducted extensive field surveys to monitor *Ambystoma* salamander populations, focusing on breeding habitats, seasonal activity, and microhabitat conditions. Collected tissue samples, recorded environmental parameters (water quality, substrate type, vegetation cover), and documented population health indicators. These datasets serve as a critical ecological context for downstream genomic analyses.  

## 🏆Fellowship & Awards
- **Gundlach Theis Fellowship - USD$3,000 - Summer 2025**
